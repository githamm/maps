                        <p><strong>By Bruce Finley</strong><br />
                            <em>The Denver Post</em></p>
                        <p><span class="dropcap">P</span>CE (short for <a href="http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/tet-ethy.html" target="_blank">perchloroethylene or tetrachloroethylene</a> and sometimes called “perc”) is a toxic chemical that, once spilled, can keep on contaminating soil, water and indoor air for decades. It’s not just the nature of PCE that causes problems but where it is used: as a solvent in metal and electronics plants and at dry cleaners, which are scattered across dense urban areas.</p>
                        <p>While no epidemiology or cancer studies have been done in Colorado, health effects of PCE are established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies. Long-term inhalation of PCE — over seven years or more — may harm the nervous system, including the brain, as well as the kidneys and liver, immune, blood and reproductive systems, according to the EPA. The central nervous system is most vulnerable. PCE can cause changes in vision, slower reactions and reduced brain function. PCE has caused cancer in animals exposed to high concentrations. However, federal studies of people who use PCE as part of their jobs did not find cancer. But EPA officials in 2012 conducted a re-assessment of PCE and concluded it is likely to cause cancer and harm nervous systems of people exposed over time to elevated levels.</p>
                        <p>Colorado health authorities have set a groundwater standard of 17 parts per billion, above which PCE must be removed. That standard was relaxed by state commissioners in 2010 from the EPA drinking water standard of 5 ppb. For indoor air, Colorado’s PCE standard is 41 micrograms per cubic meter in homes and 175 at worksites. The home standard was relaxed in 2012 from 4 micrograms.</p>
                        <p>PCE is heavier than water. When spilled, it swiftly sinks, penetrating concrete, soil and practically anything else in its way. When PCE reaches groundwater, it does not dissolve. Instead, PCE can collect against bedrock, forming pools that remain volatile for decades if the chemical is not removed or neutralized with other chemicals. Once in soil and groundwater, PCE can resurface as toxic vapors seeping into buildings.</p>
                        <p>Years ago, government health authorities focused mostly on the risk of people drinking PCE-contaminated water. But in urban areas, including Denver, most residents rely on public water supplies that are heavily treated and tested.</p>
                        <p>PCE contamination of private and municipal wells remains a threat because well operators typically do not test for it.</p>
                        <p>Today, health authorities are most concerned about the potential of PCE to reach people through air when vapors are trapped in homes and worksites. State and federal agencies do not know how many homes and businesses may be contaminated. The challenge has been simply identifying PCE underground plumes and dealing with those that are known. PCE typically is found during commercial property transactions where banks require environmental testing before loans are approved.</p>
                        <p>The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has no centralized data on PCE contamination statewide. Here’s information on some of the 86 “corrective action” sites with cleanups in progress — drawn from CDPHE files made available to The Denver Post under the Colorado Open Records Act.</p>

                                            <div id="a1stop">
                                                <h3>A-1 Stop Laundry Cleaners</h3>
                                                <em>11815 W. Colfax Ave., Lakewood 80215</em>
                                                <p>A 2005 CDPHE assessment of PCE contamination describes an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013438-a1stop-a1stoplaundry-drycleanershc022007.html#document/p20" target="_blank">underground plume extending from the former A1 Stop Cleaners “beneath the Daniels Park neighborhood and terminating at Lakewood Gulch.”</a> The PCE flows south from the former cleaners and crosses under West Pleasant Avenue, with levels in the groundwater measured at greater than 500 ppb four blocks south of Colfax. PCE levels were highest under former dry cleaning machines. The PCE contamination of groundwater nearby in Lakewood Gulch was measured at 200 to 499 ppb.<p>
                                                        <p>Indoor air testing was ordered in buildings including homes, records show. The results: “With the exception of one residence, concentrations of all volatile organic compounds in indoor air at select homes within the identified groundwater plume are below the CDPHE’s risk-based action levels.” In 2006, responsible parties submitted a cleanup plan to try to remove or neutralize PCE in soil and groundwater contamination.<p>
                                                                <p>The cleanup has been complicated in part because a former owner of the dry cleaner died, leaving heirs to perform required cleanup work. The cleanup was to include indoor air testing and remediation consisting of removal and off-site disposal of structures, debris and contaminated soil. Cleanup work has included injection of other chemicals to try to neutralize PCE. In 2007, 16,700 gallons of a potassium permanganate solution was injected, records show. A new owner purchased the property in 2010. It’s unclear from CDPHE records whether air testing was done after 2007.</p>
                                                                <p>At this site, the injection of potassium permanganate to try to neutralize PCE may have been only partially successful. In 2008, PCE contamination of groundwater on and off the property still exceeded limits, records show. A 2009 site report said that “temporary reductions in PCE concentrations appear to last less than six months before PCE groundwater concentrations rebound.” The 2009 report said “site monitoring indicates that PCE concentrations have rebounded to concentrations at or above pre-injection levels.”</p>
                                                                <p>The records show that CDPHE officials were concerned about risks to residents of inhaling PCE at this site and others around the state. “The primary pathway for potential human exposure at these sites is through inhalation of contaminated indoor air.”</p>

                                                <h3>AAA Modern Dry Cleaning, Inc.</h3>
                                                <em>2401 North Ave., Grand Junction 81501</em>
                                                <p>From 1970 to 1988, two dry cleaners operated in the Teller Arms Shopping Center in Grand Junction, near a Veterans Administration hospital and a golf course. Dry cleaner operations ceased in 1988 when the U.S. Department of Energy began work to clean up toxic uranium mill tailings buried in the area. A cleanup planning document in 2008 referred to PCE contamination of groundwater at up to 89 ppb in 2007 and up to 212 ppb in 2008. The PCE contaminated a shallow aquifer. Cleanup has been only partially successful. To prevent PCE from reaching people, a restrictive covenant was placed on the site in 2009, prohibiting removal of groundwater and soil.</p>

                                                <h3>B's New Look Cleaners</h3>
                                                <em>992 S. Peoria St., Aurora 80012</em>
                                                <p>Starting in 2008, CDPHE files show awareness of a problem that threatened children at the Children’s Chalet day care center, adjacent to a dry cleaner in an Aurora strip mall. The dry cleaner moved out of the mall, leaving the property owner responsible for cleanup. “Both soil and groundwater are contaminated with the dry cleaning solvent PCE as a result of either poor housekeeping practice and/or the mismanagement of hazardous waste,” CDPHE’s Walter Avramenko wrote in a letter to the property owner. “The indoor air samples measured very high levels of PCE within the tenant space occupied by the Children’s Chalet day care facility — concentrations that far exceed our health-based action levels.”</p>
                                                <p>A fan was installed around 2011 but PCE levels remained elevated, records show. A PCE-removal system was installed in January 2012 for continuous removal of vapors seeping into the Children’s Chalet. On the roof of the mall where vacuumed PCE was vented, CDPHE officials observed that a distance of 25 feet separated the top of that PCE venting system and an HVAC system air-intake conduit for the mall.</p>
                                                <p>The PCE detected in Children’s Chalet is thought to have spilled from dry cleaning machinery installed in an area that now is occupied by the day care. Lab test results from 2008 showed PCE levels in groundwater from 6 ppb to 29 ppb — relatively low compared with other sites. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1011425-bs-new-look-m-amp-e-1-4-784-m-amp-e-records.html#document/p1" target="_blank">Air monitoring once a year is required under a state-ordered corrective action plan</a>.</p>

A November 2007 test of liquid found at the base of a drain found PCE at 4,100 ppb, records show. PCE found in a bucket of water measured 34,000 ppb. The PCE levels in soil tested at this site were much higher than the levels CDPHE officials considered safe. </p>
                                                <p>Brisk business was done at this dry cleaner - the only plant in the Aspen area, records show. The property also was home to a gas station, between 1955 and 1970. Underground gas storage tanks were removed in 1998. The records show that a dry cleaner operated at the site since 1986.</p>
                                                <p>In 2007, the dry cleaner was using about 200 gallons of PCE a year, records show. About 24 drums, 30-gallons each, of waste sludge were generated each year. Cleanup work in progress by 2008 included excavation of the most contaminated soil.</p>

This site lies just east of Interstate 25, and north of West Eighth Avenue, within the flood plain of the South Platte River, which flows about 1,300 feet to the west of G&K Service property.

In G&K buildings, “the spilling and boiling over of PCE resulted in significant quantities of PCE-laden wash water entering floor drains,” a 2005 consultant’s report said.

CDPHE compliance unit chief Walter Avramenko in 1998 sought information from Colorado Springs officials on whether PCE-contaminated groundwater was used to water greens, “which may cause the plume to be drawn to the surface thereby allowing exposure to the solvent,” according to a letter in CDPHE files. An unknown quantity of PCE was spilled at the site in 1997, spreading to soil and reaching groundwater. The levels in groundwater were measured at “tens times the state groundwater standard.” Tests in 2007 found PCE in groundwater at up to 42 ppb, records show. And in 2010, Colorado Springs officials proposed “to complete remediation of the 1997 PCE release through monitored natural attenuation.” In 2011, tests showed PCE levels decreasing to around 6 ppb. A November 2011 letter from CDPHE to Colorado Springs officials noted PCE levels in monitoring wells only slightly above the state standard at the time of 5 ppb and that “the plume appears to be continuing to naturally attenuate.” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013452-golf-acres-m-amp-e-2-348-m-amp-e-records-reports.html" target="_blank">Groundwater Monitoring Summary</a>, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013453-golf-acres-m-amp-e-2-605-m-amp-e-records-reports.html" target="_blank">Well Abandonment Report</a></p>

                                                <p>CDPHE documents describe <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013435-hanneck-hanneck-data-report-2-3-14.html#document/p12" target="_blank">PCE contamination of groundwater at levels exceeding 800,000 ppb in October 2013</a>. State health authorities for several years have been pushing for a cleanup, cooperating with responsible parties and ordering testing to try to identify a source of the PCE plume, possibly along an abandoned sewer line running near the former Hanneck dry cleaners. Cleanup is complicated because the PCE plume has spread from the former dry cleaning site under surrounding properties — including a Safeway. State documents show “downgradient contamination levels are rising rapidly.”</p>
                                                <p>The PCE plume, still not fully mapped and measured, was “migrating into the adjoining residential community,” according to a 2012 document. CDPHE officials believed “a hazardous waste release occurred sometime within the last few years,” the document said. The cause was unclear but investigators suspected discharges into sewers. The highly-concentrated PCE “necessitates the division to act in order to protect the health and environment of the people of Colorado” and CDPHE officials warned responsible parties involved they could face fines up to $15,000 to $25,000 per day per violation of hazardous waste laws. </p>
                                                <p>The plume is spreading under a restaurant the Safeway at 560 Corona St. Safeway has installed a toxic-vapor removal system as a precaution to protect workers and shoppers against any PCE that might seep into its building. The records show Safeway also installed a charcoal water treatment system. To remove any PCE vapors, a pipe runs from Safeway’s basement up through the deli area to the roof.</p>
                                                <p>In May 2013, CDPHE officials held a meeting including lawyers representing owners of the property where the former Hanneck dry cleaners was located, Hanneck owners and state hazardous waste experts. Discussions addressed PCE contamination detected in monitoring wells at the northwest portion of Safeway’s property. CDPHE compliance unit chief Walter Avramenko referred to increasing concentrations of PCE in downgradient monitoring wells.</p>
                                                <p>CDPHE officials suggested PCE “probably was disposed of down the drain at Hanneck,” records show. Hanneck’s owner said “we did not dump anything down the drain…….I don’t know who would throw perc down the drain. My people know better. Nobody would throw perc down the drain. That’s an absurd position.” The sewer line was abandoned in 1999 and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013435-hanneck-hanneck-data-report-2-3-14.html#document/p9" target="_blank">PCE at levels up to 200,000 ppb have been measured along the sewer lines</a>, which have been scoped and lie about four feet underground, records show.</p>

File documents not that, because PCE dangers were not fully understood, hazardous wastewater often was thrown out back doors. After 1980, dry cleaner operators began putting PCE waste in containers and using hazardous waste haulers.</p>
                                                <p>This week, CDPHE officials were analyzing recent groundwater test data and weighing cleanup possibilities. No air tests have been conducted in nearby homes, CDPHE officials said, because PCE levels in groundwater at the monitoring wells closest to homes remained well below a 250 ppb threshold that health officials use in assessing risks of exposure. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013435-hanneck-hanneck-data-report-2-3-14.html" target="_blank">Data Report - Feb. 3, 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1011746-hanneck-m-amp-e-2-403-m-amp-e-records-reports.html" target="_blank">Mitigation Measures Document</a></p>

                                                <p>A 2011 site report said Holiday was run as a dry cleaning facility where the use of PCE was discontinued in July 2008. Indoor air samples measured at the dry cleaner building found PCE levels exceeding the residential indoor air standard but not the commercial industrial air standard. The main pathway of concern, CDPHE documents show, is from contaminated groundwater in a shallow aquifer. “The deeper aquifer beneath the site does not appear to be impacted.” No municipal pumping wells were observed in the area. Groundwater tests in 2004 found PCE at levels up to 4,668 ppb. In April 2010, tests found PCE at 1,590 ppb. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013455-holiday-holiday-cleaners-groundwater-sampling.html" target="_blank">Groundwater Sampling Report</a></p>

                                                <p>Katzson has served as a regional supplier of PCE to dry cleaners. The Katzson facility, located west of downtown Denver in the South Platte River Valley, operated for more than 50 years along railroad tracks where PCE was unloaded in the past and stored in above-ground tanks. This is an industrial zone where risks of human exposure have been deemed minimal, records show. State health officials have known about problems at the site since the 1980s. Federal authorities say the site is heavily contaminated with PCE at levels up to 310,000 ppb.<p>
                                                        <p>Cleanup has dragged out for years. Environmental Protection Agency officials measured PCE contamination in 1992 at levels far exceeding state standards. Katzson has intalled indoor air ventilation systems in buildings, EPA officials said. Soil sampling has been done to measure the underground contamination, which appears most concentrated at the railroad off-loading area. Katzson also has injected potassium permanganate to try to neutralize PCE, and EPA officials say this approach has reduced PCE levels to around 22,000 ppb. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013459-katzson-m-amp-e-records-reports-quarterly-status.html" target="_blank">Quarterly Status Report - Q1 2013</a></p>

                                                <p>CDPHE files refer to data showing rising PCE contamination measured in municipal drinking water wells in the city of Security, starting in 2006. The contamination reached 10 ppb in one well, double the EPA drinking water standard of 5 ppb for PCE. Thousands of residents of the Security area rely on a series of ten wells sunk about 40 feet into alluvial aquifers along Fountain Creek, which flows into the Arkansas River. The PCE forced a shut-down of one well, forcing Security to line up alternative surface water supplies.</p>
                                                <p>State health officials held a teleconference in 2009 with the owner of the King’s One Hour dry cleaner, located more than a mile north of the shut-down well, records show. State records show the dry cleaner was vacant after 2010 and officials say the owner fled to South Korea leaving nobody to turn to for cleanup. In 2010, an environmental contractor proposed monitoring a PCE plume from the nearby Schlage Lock plant in Security. A PCE plume from this plant, identified in the 1970s, contaminated groundwater in the area — prompting a cleanup. CDPHE officials determined that the plumes were separate, that the PCE contaminating municipal drinking water wells came from the dry cleaner. CDPHE turned to the EPA for help because of the risk that people could be exposed to PCE. EPA contractors decided a water treatment plant would have to be built and that PCE-tainted water would have to be re-routed through it to remove PCE. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1015774-kings-kings-one-hour-cleaners-corrective-action.html" target="_blank">Corrective Action Plan</a></p>

PCE samples from East Evans Avenue indicated concentrations around 117 ppb. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013465-master-clean-m-amp-e-2-324-m-amp-e-records.html#document/p4" target="_blank">CDPHE now holds an environmental covenant on this site</a>. The covenant restricts groundwater removal, soil disturbance, and limits the use of the property for residential and other purposes involving subpopulations that are more susceptible to injury from indoor air contamination such as hospitals and day care centers. The groundwater here flows in a west — northwest direction and PCE levels detected at seven on-site wells exceeded state standards, ranging from 14.1 ppb to 167 ppb. CDPHE records from 2012 indicate remedial work was being done at the site. A July 10, 2012, CDPHE email said: “these data indicate that chlorinated solvents continue to be present in groundwater from the facility at levels in excess of state standards both on and off the subject property.”</p>

But PCE contamination appears serious. A test in groundwater at the edge of the shopping center property in 2010 found PCE at levels ranging from 1,600 to 110,000 ppb. The PCE plume was “migrating off the Thornton Shopping Center, causing PCE to be present in soil gas in the areas tested near the Corona Village Condominium property,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1015773-monarch-monarch-approval-letter.html" target="_blank">CDPHE officials Charles Adams and Walter Avramenko wrote in a May 2012 letter</a>.

                                                <p>Cleanup at this site, located north of Cherry Creek, was still in progress. But an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013469-royal-express-m-amp-e-2-469-m-amp-e-records.html" target="_blank">April 2013 e-mail in CDPHE files said new wells for monitoring an underground PCE plume flowing southwest toward the creek measured PCE levels at 3.7 ppb</a> — below the state standard. Dry cleaner owners had contracted with environmental firms to manage cleanup.</p>
                                                <p>This marked an improvement since September 2011, when groundwater tests in monitoring wells found “elevated levels of PCE above state standards.” Back then, PCE was measured in groundwater about 18 feet below the surface at levels ranging from 24 ppb to 200 ppb.</p>
                                                <p>CDPHE records show that health officials planned to investigate contamination at this site in 2001.</p>
                                                <p>In 2005, a state inspection at the dry cleaners found an operation in which PCE wastewater was placed in two 1-gallon rice cookers sitting atop a drum, records show. The drum held PCE waste. Some had leaked onto the concrete floor in a boiler-room “from a hole corroded in the sidewall,” records show. The drum was sitting near a vent pipe. “The boiler vent pipe discharges steam and water condensate onto the rear loading dock, flowing down onto the asphalt pavement of the rear access road.”</p>
                                                <p>After that inspection, a letter to dry cleaner owners from CDPHE’s compliance chief Walter Avramenko noted a “steady discharge” and warned that “the chemical of concern, PCE, is very mobile and capable of dissolving in water and/or penetrating concrete and asphalt.” The dry cleaner apparently relied on a 40-gallon PCE tank capable of cleaning six loads of clothing a day, kicking out 10 to 20 gallons of PCe waste per month along with sludge and spent filters. State records show that some of this waste was put in the boiler room where the Oster rice cookers were found.</p>
                                                <p>In 2008, the dry cleaner operators informed CDPHE officials that they had stopped using hazardous chemicals and producing hazardous waste.</p>

                                                <p>CDPHE authorities first became aware of contamination at the site of this former dry cleaners in 2008. PCE contamination of groundwater was measured “at a concentration ten times the Colorado groundwater standard,” records show. “This contaminated groundwater migrates off-site and enters a residential area within which are found a number of private groundwater wells that could potentially be affected” and the result could be “unknowing exposure to PCE.”</p>
                                                <p>The dry cleaners was located adjacent to the Austin Bluffs Center and Doherty High School. A restaurant was next to the Shalom Cleaners. When a cleanup plan was presented in 2010, several former dry cleaners operating at the site since 1982 were mentioned as possible sources of PCE, including a Kings One-Hour.</p>
                                                <p>State officials identified a trust as the current legally responsible party.</p>
                                                <p>Groundwater tests in 2009 found PCE at up to 51 ppb. CDPHE ordered tests of a dozen or so private wells within 1,300 feet of the suspected source area and, in 2012, installation of a PCE vapor-removal system.</p>
                                                <p>The responsible owner decided to halt cleanup work in early 2009 and, in 2010, pleaded financial hardship. CDPHE’s Walter Avramenko worked to prevent abandonment of the site. He wrote to the owner, saying that “I understand your resources are limited and the site does not currently generate sufficient revenue. On the other hand, please recognize the Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division’s obligation to ensure cleanup as soon as possible.” State records show Avramenko later commended the owner’s willingness “to resume work…. To take care of the problems within your limited financial means.” He said that CDPHE was “preparing to take legal action.” State records included a reference to a consultant’s estimate that full cleanup to meet health standards would cost “hundreds of thousands of dollars.”</p>
                                                <p>CDPHE officials tried to encourage a cooperative approach. “Following issuance of the unilateral order, we would be willing to discuss terms of an order on consent, negotiated with you, that could replace the unilateral order.”</p>
                                                <p>Meanwhile, state efforts in 2011 to contact private well owners and warn them of potential threats were partially successful. About a dozen wells were tested. PCE contamination was detected in two, records show. The PCE level in one well was 37 ppb.</p>
                                                <p>Cleanup is not complete at this site and the source isn’t certain. A 2011 camera inspection of sewer lines leading from Shalom Cleaners found a low spot where PCE had pooled. A 2012 CDPHE document noted “the widespread nature of PCE contaminated groundwater.” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013473-shalom-m-amp-e-2-594-m-amp-e-records-reports.html" target="_blank">Monitoring report - Aug. 5, 2013</a></p>

When contractors moved it, 3-5 gallons of PCE spilled on the floor and drained out through cracks.<p>
                                                        <p>Soil tests later found heavy PCE contamination under the building and PCE contamination of groundwater at levels as high as 6,000 ppb. CDPHE records show health officials believed PCE contamination may resulted from more than the 1996 spill.</p>
                                                        <p>CDPHE ordered installation of a PCE vapor-removal system in 1997 and indoor air tests at three residences. In 200, air tests found PCE contamination of indoor air in one living room at the level of 3 micrograms per cubic meter – just below the 4 micrograms health standard at that time, records show. Colorado’s home air standard for PCE since then has been relaxed to 41 micrograms.</p>
                                                        <p>Cleanup at the site was to include continued indoor air monitoring and injection of potassium permanganate to try to neutralize PCE and preventing the plume from spreading. Trenches were dug to try to block the plume by treating PCE-laced groundwater. A CDPHE letter to investors who now own the property said PCE levels in groundwater decreased from up to 600 ppb in 2006 to about 100 in 2011. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013476-solar-clean-m-amp-e-2-673-m-amp-e-records.html" target="_blank">Water sample results - Sept. 25, 2013</a></p>

                                                <p>A dry cleaner operated since at least 1980 at this site, which was developed as a multi-tenant office and retail center, where a plume of PCE-contaminated groundwater is being monitored. CDPHE records show that the water table sits one to 18 feet beneath the surface and that the location is near the Yampa River. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1013477-sundance-2013-sundance-monitoring-report.html#document/p5" target="_blank">Groundwater tests in 2010 show PCE at levels up to 150 ppb</a>.
