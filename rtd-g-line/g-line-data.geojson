        "blurb": "<p>The first stop on the G-Line is what Chris Nevitt, manager of transit-oriented development for Denver, characterizes as a \"pretty interesting, eclectic area.\" Part of the Globeville neighborhood, the area features a diversity of businesses from a pot dispensary to a custom steel fabrication shop to a recording studio to a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training center.</p><p>\"We like industrial uses that have primary jobs and good employers,\" Nevitt said.</p><p>But dense housing, often a hallmark of transit-oriented developments, is not far away for an area some call \"Fox Island\" because of its sequestration from the rest of the city -- hemmed in by Interstate 25 to the east, Interstate 70 to the north and multiple rail lines to the west.</p><p>Nevitt said the 41-acre island could see several thousand housing units built over the next 20 years or so, much of it on vacant land surrounding the former Denver Post printing plant. As recently as February, <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2019/02/25/denver-fox-island-development/\" target=\"_blank\">City Council approved rezonings to allow</a> for a project featuring 120 micro apartments on North Elati Street and several townhomes at 42nd Avenue and Delaware Street.</p><p>There's even a plan for homes perched atop a Home Depot store just south of the RTD rail station, Nevitt said.</p><p>It's also pretty controversial. Former Denver city planner Katherine Cornwell recently launched a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/denver-city-council-mayor-michael-hancock-no-home-depot-at-the-globeville-sunnyside-light-rail-station\" target=\"_blank\">Change.org petition</a> denouncing the store as \"big box retail\" that \"will create a traffic nightmare.\"</p><p>\"We demand that this land be preserved for transit-oriented development that includes affordable housing and prioritizes walking, biking, and transit,\" the petition urges.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 41st &amp; Fox stop is already prompting development off Fox Island -- like in the Sunnyside neighborhood to the west. The 429-unit Zia Apartments &amp; Condos project on Inca Street, connected to the station by a pedestrian bridge, is under construction.</p>",

That's not a bad thing, said Kristin Sullivan, who recently moved from Adams County's community and economic development director to its public works director.</p><p>By being an employment center rather than primarily a jumping-off point for destinations further afield, she said, Pecos Junction is a unique stop in RTD's FasTracks system.</p><p>\"A lot of other stations are discouraging industrial,\" Sullivan said.</p><p>Adams County projects that over the next 12 to 20 years, 2,000 jobs will be created around the rail station and 1.5 million square feet of commercial will sprout. Sullivan admits the county would like some of that new space to be \"higher-quality industrial\" than what is there now.</p><p>She points to plans to develop 45-acre site just southwest of Pecos Junction station that Rocky Mountain Prestress sold to Westfield Co. for more than $40 million, <a href=\"https://businessden.com/2018/12/11/industrial-site-just-north-of-city-limits-sells-for-41m/\" target=\"_blank\">as reported by BusinessDen</a> in December.</p><p>The firm told Adams County that it wants to build three industrial warehouses at the northwest corner of West 56th Avenue and Pecos Street that each measure nearly half a million square feet.</p><p>Sullivan's excited that things are starting to fall into place for a long-struggling part of the metro area -- first with the advent of the mixed-use Midtown at Clear Creek project at 66th Avenue and Pecos Street and now with the imminent opening of Pecos Junction station.</p><p>\"With the long delay in the opening of the G-Line, the market hadn't responded,\" she said. \"But a lot of landowners are now entertaining options.\"</p>",

Across Federal Boulevard, <a href=\"https://clearcreektransitvillage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Clear Creek Transit Village boasts</a> that it will have 1,125 residential units and 250,000 square feet of commercial space on 21 acres.</p><p>Just south of the station, a 12-acre parcel in the shadow of I-76 is being primed for 1,500 multifamily units and 25,000 square feet of commercial real estate.</p><p>Then there are the 20 acres across West 60th Avenue from the station owned by Brannan Sand and Gravel. Facing county zoning code violations, Sullivan said the company may soon have to make some tough decisions about whether to continue its operations there.</p><p>If the company sells, the opportunity for a signature transit-oriented project comes into view.</p><p>\"It's unique to have 20 acres right next to a transit station,\" Sullivan said.</p>",

That means the city wants to \"create something\" that will harness the advantages transit can bring to a community, said City Manager Patrick Goff.</p><p>But because the station is cut off from the rest of the city by I-70 and is set amid existing businesses, Goff said the plan for Ward station relies to a large degree on infill development that will complement what's already there.</p><p>\"It doesn't go through our downtown, which would definitely take a different strategy,\" he said. \"It's not going to be what a lot of people think of as a traditional transit-oriented development site.\"</p><p>Multifamily housing around the station is moving forward. TRAX at Ward calls for 221 market-rate apartments while the Hance Ranch project will bring 63 townhomes to land northeast of the station. Meanwhile, the 15-acre site on Ward Road that was once home to a Jolly Ranch candy plant is being groomed for 200 townhomes and 6,000 square feet of commercial space.</p><p>But Goff said there will be an emphasis on bringing in businesses that focus on the outdoor recreation space, given the station's proximity to the foothills and area trail networks. Wheat Ridge City Council has referred to the area around the station <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2016/12/05/wheat-ridge-outdoor-recreation-base-camp-rail-stop/\" target=\"_blank\">as a potential \"base camp\" for outdoor recreation companies</a> sharing co-working space.</p><p>Voters in the city passed a sales tax increase in 2016 that directs $12 million to the Ward station area to fund infrastructure improvements. Goff said with opening day for the G-Line right around the corner, the hope is that private capital will follow the financial commitment from taxpayers.</p>",
